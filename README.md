## Project Goals

The purpose in one of the four milestone projects is based on a firm decision, having considered some project ideas, to extract and utilise Code Institute's example of developing a professional website portfolio. The focal motivation serves as a specific well founded need and aligns towards my personal primary goal of accomplishing a career change, to cater for the target audience in presenting useful information to the users and reach out to potential prospective employers & recruiters.

## Strategy

As established in the aforementioned above, the product is built consciously with the employers and recruiters in mind to provide the ability in assessing of what I can offer, contribute and participate overall personally and professionally.
