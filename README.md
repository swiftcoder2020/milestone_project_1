# Overview of the Milestone 1 Project

This first project provided an opportunity to demonstrate my technical knowledge, skills and experience in twofold of project management and website development to construct a static front-end site. Consideration is taken in encompassing all aspects of User Experience Design (UXD) that forms the core part of this development, incorporating the 5 planes methodology and utilising the languages, tool & technologies learnt within the module aforementioned.

# User Experience Design (UXD)

## Project Goals

The purpose in one of the four milestone projects is based on a firm decision, having considered some project ideas, to extract and utilise Code Institute's example of developing a professional website portfolio. The focal motivation serves as a specific well founded personal need and aligns towards my primary goal of accomplishing a career change, to cater for the target audience in presenting useful information to the users and reach out to potential prospective employers & recruiters.

## Strategy

As established in the aforementioned above, the product is built consciously with the employers and recruiters in mind to provide the ability in assessing of what I can offer, contribute and participate collaboratively overall personally and professionally. The objective of this strategy is to market myself as a product and provide value in that through the website portfolio lifecycle from inception to deployment and finally testing to enable the transition into a career change to take effect.

## Scope

### User Stories

#### Employers and Recruiters

Both of these types of users operate as separate entities of their own in that there is a greater likelihood of them browsing through the website portfolio, assessing one's competency levels through their own project work and connect via various professional social media/collaborative means i.e. LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and GitHub. Therefore from their perspective, these key points have been identified as follows:

##### *Employer's Perspective*

* As a user of a prospective employer, who is seeking for a candidate within the role of a Full Stack, Front-end or Back-end Website Developer, it is of interest to have the ability to explore the website portfolio to comprehend who that person is personally and professionally.

* As an employer, it is of great interest to experience the ability to comprehend and assess the level of the developer's technical competencies/experience through their own project work via GitHub, that the various websites functions ideally with no bugs, they possess the ability to be practical through their problem solving skills, there is clarity in their attention to detail within the code whilst demonstrating good practices and evidence is present that the candidate has the ability to design and construct a website through a lifecycle of development processes.

* As an employer, it is of great interest to experience the ability to recognise that the candidate possesses a level of professionalism and creativity, which reflects the aesthetically appealing website that they have built whilst placing an emphasis on accessibility.

* As an employer, there is an incentive to obtain a Curriculum Vitae which is easily shareable to other members of their company/business that assists with the decision-making to invite that candidate for a potential interview and with a view to recruit that individual.

##### *Recruiter's Perspective*

* As a user, there is a responsibility to efficiently identify an accumulation of potential developers to suggest to their portfolio of clients with specific requirements to be matched therefore the functionality of the website portfolio that enables the value in accessing useful information is essential for a recommendation to take effect.

##### *Combined User's Perspectives*

* As a user, the ability to comprehend the purpose of the website efficiently with ease so that it can be determined effectively whether the candidate is worth pursuing.

* As a user, the website portfolio provides the content which is expected to be rendered easily, swiftly and responsively via navigational links and is achieved through means of a peripheral or alternatively through various assistive technologies.

#### Website Developer 

As the sole candidate in being a trainee software developer, I am aiming to contribute towards the project goals and strategy of securing the opportunity of employment within the industry of website development to increase my prospects of a fulfilling career, which I am passionate about.
