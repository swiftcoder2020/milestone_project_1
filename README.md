# Overview of the Milestone 1 Project

This first project provided an opportunity to demonstrate with evidence of my technical skills, knowledge and experience in twofold of project management and website development to construct a static front-end site, which considers encompassing all aspects of User Experience Design (UXD) that forms the core part of this development, incorporating the 5 planes methodology and utilising the languages, tool & technologies learnt within the module aforementioned.

# User Experience Design (UXD)

## Project Goals

The purpose in one of the four milestone projects is based on a firm decision, having considered some project ideas, to extract and utilise Code Institute's example of developing a professional website portfolio. The focal motivation serves as a specific well founded need and aligns towards my personal primary goal of accomplishing a career change, to cater for the target audience in presenting useful information to the users and reach out to potential prospective employers & recruiters.

## Strategy

As established in the aforementioned above, the product is built consciously with the employers and recruiters in mind to provide the ability in assessing of what I can offer, contribute and participate collaboratively overall personally and professionally. The objective of this strategy is to market myself as a product and provide value in that through the website portfolio lifecycle from inception to deployment and finally testing to enable the transition into a career change to take effect.

## User Stories

### Employers and Recruiters

Both of these types of users operate as separate entities of their own in that there is a greater likelihood of them browsing through the website portfolio, assessing one's competency levels through their own project work and connect via various professional social media/collaborative means i.e. LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and GitHub. Therefore from their perspective:

*Employers*

* As a user, it is of interest

*Recruiters*

* As a user, it is of interest

### Website Developer 

As the sole developer and a candidate, I am aiming to contribute towards the project goals and strategy
