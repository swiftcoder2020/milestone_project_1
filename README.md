# Overview of the Milestone 1 Project

This first project provided an opportunity to demonstrate my technical knowledge, skills and experience in twofold of project management and website development to construct a static front-end site. Consideration is taken in encompassing all aspects of User Experience Design (UXD) that forms the core part of this development, incorporating the 5 planes methodology and utilising the languages, tool & technologies learnt within the module aforementioned.

# User Experience Design (UXD)

## Project Goals

The purpose in one of the four milestone projects is based on a firm decision, having considered some project ideas, to extract and utilise Code Institute's example of developing a professional website portfolio. The focal motivation serves as a specific well founded personal need and aligns towards my primary goal of accomplishing a career change, to cater for the target audience in presenting useful information to the users and reach out to potential prospective employers & recruiters.

## Strategy

As established above, the product is built consciously with the employers and recruiters in mind to provide the ability in assessing of what I can offer, contribute and participate collaboratively overall personally and professionally. The objective of this strategy is to market myself as a product and provide value in that through the website portfolio lifecycle from inception to deployment and finally testing to enable the transition into a career change to take effect.

With this in mind, the primary focus was to project into the build of a subtle yet appealing website portfolio that encompasses the learning principles and methodologies into the CI's Full Stack Website Development course to demonstrate the effect of good judgements & practices into the design

## Scope

### User Stories

1. Employers and Recruiters

Both of these types of users operate as separate entities of their own processes in that there is a different approach when it comes to browsing through the website portfolio, assessing one's competency levels through their own project work and connecting via various professional social media/collaborative means i.e. LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and GitHub. Therefore from their perspective, these key points have been identified as follows:

#### *Employer's Perspective*

* As a user of a prospective employer, who is seeking for a candidate within the role of a Full Stack, Front-end or Back-end Website Developer, it is of interest when there is the ability to explore the website portfolio in order to comprehend who that person is personally and professionally.

* As an employer, it is of great value to experience the ability to comprehensively understand and assess the level of the developer's technical competencies/experiences through their own project work via GitHub, that the various websites functions ideally with no bugs, they possess the ability to be practical through their problem solving skills, there is clarity in their attention to detail within the code whilst demonstrating good practices and evidence is present that the candidate has the ability to design through the concept of UX and construct a website by considering the lifecycle of development processes.

* As an employer, it is of great interest to experience the ability to recognise that the candidate possesses a level of professionalism, methodology & creativity, which reflects the aesthetically appealing website that they have built whilst placing an emphasis on accessibility.

* As an employer, there is an incentive to obtain a Curriculum Vitae which is easily shareable to other members of their company/business that assists with the decision-making to invite that candidate for a potential interview and with a view to recruit that individual.

#### *Recruiter's Perspective*

* As a user, there is a continuous responsibility to efficiently identify from an accumulation of potential employable developers to suggest to their portfolio of clients with various specific criterias that ticks most boxes in becoming a good match to be recruited into the company/business of many forms whether small, medium or large. In effect, the responsive performance into the functionality of the website portfolio enables the value in accessing useful information, is essential for a recommendation to a client to take effect.

#### *Combined User's Perspectives*

* As a user, the ability to instantly establish the purpose of the website efficiently with ease can determine effectively whether the candidate is worth pursuing.

* As a user, the website portfolio provides the content which is expected to be rendered easily, swiftly and responsively via navigational links and is achieved through means of a peripheral or alternatively through various assistive technologies.

* As a user, the ability to assess the history of an education and employment nature is a contributory factor in potentially interviewing and recruiting the candidate, especially when the candidate updates their website with new examples of their project work.

* As a user, there is a range of means in contacting the candidate through a form via the website, or alternative methods such as social media, email or telephone/mobile number.

2. Website Developer 

As a trainee software developer in being a sole candidate, I am aiming to wholly contribute towards the project goals and strategy of securing the opportunity of employment within the industry of website development to increase my prospects of a fulfilling career, which I am passionate about.
