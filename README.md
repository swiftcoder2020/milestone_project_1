# Overview of the Milestone 1 Project

This first project provides an opportunity to demonstrate my technical knowledge and skills learnt within the Full Stack Website Development course, yet blending in some experience in both aspects of project management and website development respectively to construct a static front-end site. Consideration is taken in encompassing all aspects of User Experience Design (UXD) that forms the core part of this development, incorporating the 5 planes methodology and utilising the languages, tool & technologies learnt within the module aforementioned.

# User Experience Design (UXD)

## Project Goals

The purpose into one of the four milestone projects is based on a firm decision, having considered some project ideas, to extract and utilise Code Institute's example of developing a professional website portfolio. The focal motivation serves as a specific well founded personal need and aligns towards my primary goal of accomplishing a career change, to cater for the target audience in presenting useful & relevant information which derives from the traditional Curriculum Vitae, demonstrating functionality & accessibility to the users and in conclusion, reach out to potential prospective employers & recruiters.

## Strategy

As established above, the product is built consciously with the employers and recruiters in mind, specifically their business recruitment objectives to provide them the value in the ability to assess what I can offer, to contribute and participate collaboratively overall as a candidate, personally and professionally. The objective of this strategy is to market myself as a product and provide value in that through the lifecycle in the development of the website portfolio, from inception to deployment and finally testing to enable the potential transition into a career change to take effect.

With this in mind, the primary focus is to project into the build of a website as a subtle yet bold professional portfolio that encompasses the learning principles and methodologies from the course and various resources to ensure it is user-friendly and well-structured, with the aim of conveying this to prospective employers in assisting them to achieve in the duration of their browsing experience to provide that value.

In the duration of the conception stage in planning for this project, research was undertaken to establish what other portfolio based websites had been developed and through my educational knowledge and professional experience, I was able to factor in the user's viewpoint by visiting those examples to utilise the current tools and technologies to ascertain the appropriate features, design & styling themes and structure. Through experience, I identified that the target audience is going to be diverse, thus the website portfolio requires to cater for this wide net of opportunities.

## Scope

### User Stories

1. Employers and Recruiters

Both of these types of users operate as separate entities of their own processes in that there is a different approach when it comes to browsing through the website portfolio, assessing one's competency levels and connecting via various professional social media/collaborative means i.e. LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and GitHub etc. Therefore from their perspective, these key points have been identified as follows:

#### *Employer's Perspective*

* As a user of a prospective employer, who is seeking for a candidate within various roles of a Full Stack, Front-end or Back-end Website Developer, it is of interest when there is the ability to explore the website portfolio in order to comprehend who that individual is personally and professionally.

* As an employer, it is of great value to experience the ability in browsing through a candidate's website portfolio to grasp key relevant information via the content that is provided based on a Curriculum Vitae, which is rendered correctly through the design methodology and principles, whilst expressing creativity that reflects the aesthetically appealing product that the individual has built and places an emphasis on accessibility.

* As a user in wanting to employ a candidate, consideration is taken in the great value towards a level of professionalism whereby, the ability to comprehensively understand and assess the developer's technical competencies/logical thinking/experiences through their own project works by way of GitHub, and an active link is offered to demonstrate their capability to reach the goal of being invited for an interview, on the basis of how well a candidate achieves being matched to a job description and person specification.

* As an employer, there is an incentive to obtain a Curriculum Vitae which is easily shareable to other members of their company/business that assists with the decision-making to invite that candidate for a potential interview and with a view to recruit that individual.

#### *Recruiter's Perspective*

* As a user of a recruiter, there is a continuous responsibility to efficiently identify, from an accumulation of potential employable developers, to suggest to their portfolio of clients. Various specific criterias are determined by striving to target suitable candidates that is a good match for the client representing a company/business in many forms whether small, medium or large. Therefore in effect, the responsive performance into the functionality of the website portfolio enables the great value in accessing useful information, is essential for a recommendation to a client to take effect.

#### *Combined User's Perspectives*

* As a combination of users, there is the viewpoint that by browsing, the website portfolio provides the content which is expected to be rendered fluently, swiftly and responsively via accessing active navigational links and is achieved through means of a peripheral or alternatively through various assistive technologies.

* As a user, a contributory factor in interviewing and recruiting the candidate is based upon assessing the background history into their education and employment, especially when the developer updates their website with new examples of recent project work.

* As a user, the ability to instantly establish the purpose of the website efficiently with ease can determine effectively whether the candidate is worth pursuing.

* As a user, there is a range of means in contacting the candidate through a form via the website, or alternative methods such as social media, email or telephone/mobile number.

2. Website Developer 

As a trainee Full Stack Website Developer, I am solely aiming to contribute towards the project goals and strategy, endeavouring to secure the opportunity of employment within the industry of website development to increase my prospects of a fulfilling career, which I am passionate about. It is through my technical knowledge, skills and capability that I have an interest in comprehending the full aspects of how a website is developed through current languages, tools & technologies to make a difference in people's personal & professional lives through my coding ability.

<!-- On consideration of the content requirements which contributes towards the scope and having undertaken research into what constitutes as appropriate features that is currently available

into the website portfolio which enhances the elements of the Curriculum Vitae, I have identified by way of Bootstrap and other tools or technologies, what these will consist of

to incorporate & utilise from the framework such as a progress bar to portray the current skills -->

## Structure

### *Information Architecture*

Previous experience in website development has enabled me to identify within this milestone project that a site structure is required when undertaking the planning preparations to construct a website, and to this day as of September 2020 this is no different given that it concerns the organisational and navigational schemas.

## Skeleton

For the purpose of providing the skeleton of the website portfolio, I had decided to utilise Code Institute's suggestion of the Balsamiq software

## Surface

# Features

# Languages, Tools & Technologies Utilised

* Bootstrap v4.5.2
* Google Fonts
* Font Awesome
* HTML
* CSS

# Testing

<!-- realised that I hadn't considered the element of accessibility, therefore amended the colour scheme slightly as the contrast ration was a bit low after running through https://www.accessible-colors.com -->

<!-- logo image was overflowing, yet after consulting with the slack community it was because the logo was set at 320px and needed to be set at 200px -->

<!-- experienced a margin/padding issue to Bootstrap's grid whereby each skill block wasn't being separated -->
