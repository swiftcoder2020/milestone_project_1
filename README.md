# Overview of the Milestone 1 Project

This first project provides an opportunity to demonstrate my technical knowledge and skills learnt within the Full Stack Website Development course, yet blending in some experience in both aspects of project management and website development respectively to construct a static front-end site. Consideration is taken in encompassing all aspects of User Experience Design (UXD) that forms the core part of this development, incorporating the 5 planes methodology, ensuring the responsiveness of the website and utilising the languages, tool & technologies learnt within the module aforementioned.

# User Experience Design (UXD)

## Project Goals

The purpose into one of the four milestone projects is based on a firm decision, having considered some project ideas, to extract and utilise Code Institute's example of developing a professional website portfolio. The focal motivation serves as a specific well founded personal need and aligns towards my primary goal of accomplishing a career change, to cater for the target audience in presenting useful & relevant information which derives from the traditional Curriculum Vitae, demonstrating functionality & accessibility to the users and in conclusion, reach out to potential prospective employers & recruiters.

## Strategy

As established above, the product is built consciously with the employers and recruiters in mind, specifically their business recruitment objectives to provide them the value in the ability to assess what I can offer overall as a candidate, professionally and personally that is worthy for consideration into a job role applied. The objective of this strategy is to market myself as a product and provide value through the lifecycle in the development of the website portfolio, from conception to deployment and finally testing to enable the potential transition into a career change to take effect.

With this in mind, the primary focus is to project into the build of a website as a subtle yet bold, professional portfolio that encompasses the learning principles and methodologies from the course, whilst utilising various resources to ensure it is user-friendly and well-structured. The aim of this is to convey to prospective employers in assisting them to achieve their goal in the duration of their browsing experience to provide that value.

In the duration of the conception stage in planning for this project, research was undertaken to establish what other portfolio based websites had been developed and through my educational knowledge and some professional experience, I was able to factor in the user's viewpoint by visiting those examples to utilise the current tools and technologies to ascertain the appropriate features, design & styling themes, especially making colour & images accessible and structure. Through experience, I identified that the target audience is going to be diverse, thus the website portfolio requires to cater for this wide net of opportunities.

## Scope

### User Stories

1. Employers and Recruiters

Both of these types of users operate as separate entities with their own processes relating to recruitment in that there are different approaches when it comes to browsing through the website portfolio, therefore the user experience needs to cater for this such as briefly assessing one's competency levels through the content and development of the coding into the website and also connecting via various professional relevant social media/collaborative means i.e. GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter etc. Therefore from their perspective, these key points have been identified as follows:

#### *Employer's Perspective*

* As a user of a prospective employer, it is an incentive to experience the ability in browsing through a candidate's website portfolio to grasp key relevant information via the content, that is derived from a Curriculum Vitae which can be obtained in its traditional form for it to be easily shareable to the interview panel, assists with the decision-making to invite that candidate for a potential interview with a view to recruit that individual and that it is rendered correctly through the design methodology and principles.

* As an employer who is seeking for a candidate within various roles of a Full Stack, Front-end or Back-end Website Developer, it is of great value when there is the ability to explore the website portfolio to consciously understand and assess the developer's technical competencies/logical thinking in the development lifecycle/experiences through their own project works by way of GitHub or via a URL through their hosting ISP, which an active link is offered to demonstrate this.

* As a user in wanting to employ a candidate, great value is identified towards the confidence in the capability of skillfully coding the website, whilst expressing creativity that reflects the aesthetically appealing product that the individual has built and places an emphasis on accessibility.

#### *Recruiter's Perspective*

* As a user of a recruiter, there is a continuous responsibility to efficiently identify from an accumulation of potential developers, to suggest to their portfolio of clients who will have various specific criterias that are determined from a range of companies/businesses whether small, medium or large. Therefore in effect, the responsive performance into the functionality of the website portfolio enables the great value in accessing useful information, is essential for a recommendation to a client to take effect.

* As a recruiter, it is difficult to grasp the in-depth knowledge of the employer that determines whether the targeted suitable candidates is a good match to the representative client's requirements therefore by obtaining a Curriculum Vitae which is widely recognised, it concisely outlines the skills of various candidates and assesses their employment & educational history.

* As a user, we receive requests to fill positions on a temporary/contractual basis or identify talents from large firms therefore candidates will need to demonstrate with proof of their capability to ensure that the role is accomplished or sustained respectively.

#### *Combined User's Perspectives*

* As a combination of users, there is the viewpoint that by browsing, the website portfolio provides the content which is expected to be rendered fluently, swiftly and responsively via accessing active navigational links and is achieved through means of a peripheral or alternatively through various assistive technologies.

* As a user, a contributory factor in interviewing and recruiting the candidate is based upon assessing the background history into their education and employment, especially when the developer updates their website or GitHub with new examples of recent project work.

* As a user, the ability to instantly establish the purpose of the website efficiently with ease through content which can determine effectively whether the candidate is worth pursuing.

* As a user, there is a range of means in contacting the candidate through a form via the website, or alternative methods such as social media, email or telephone/mobile number provided via their Curriculum Vitae.

2. Website Developer 

As a trainee Full Stack Website Developer, I am solely aiming to fully contribute towards the project goals and strategy, endeavouring to secure the opportunity of employment within the industry of website development to increase my prospects of a fulfilling career, which I am passionate about. It is through my technical knowledge, skills and capability that I have an interest in comprehending the full aspects of how a website is developed through current languages, tools & technologies to make a difference in people's personal & professional lives through my coding ability.

## Structure

The purpose of the Structure plane is to provide the aforementioned users within the Scope an enhanced view aesthetically of a Curriculum Vitae which can be sectioned out accordingly to various separate webpages as deemed fit in order to break up the content as opposed to incorporating them all into one page. I feel with some website development experience that with reference to the Structure illustration chart, I have identified that this website is simple and linear with a view for it to be in the middle of the ball-park per se as I develop the website deeply to create a high standard website portfolio. The navigation will feature a fixed-top feature that will enable users to scroll down effortlessly ensuring that the navigational links remain visible no matter how far down the content goes.

### *Information Architecture*

Previous reasonable experience in website development a decade ago has enabled a benefit to my advantage for this milestone project in that I had already established a site structure, which is required when undertaking the planning preparations to construct a website, and to this day as of September 2020, this is no different given that it concerns the organisational and navigational schemas.

## Skeleton

For the purpose of providing the skeleton of the website portfolio, I had decided to utilise Code Institute's suggestion of the Balsamiq software

## Surface

# Features

# Languages, Tools & Technologies Utilised

* Bootstrap v4.5.2
* Google Fonts
* Font Awesome
* HTML
* CSS

# Testing

<!-- realised that I hadn't considered the element of accessibility, therefore amended the colour scheme slightly as the contrast ration was a bit low after running through https://www.accessible-colors.com -->

<!-- logo image was overflowing, yet after consulting with the slack community it was because the logo was set at 320px and needed to be set at 200px -->

<!-- experienced a margin/padding issue to Bootstrap's grid whereby each skill block wasn't being separated -->

<!-- code validators from w3c, manually checking on different browsers, document the process -->

<!-- had issue with fixed-top on navbar but fixed it with putting body { padding-top: 80px; } at mobile view, then at laptop view increased this in media queries to 130px and also increased the viewheight of hero image to 70vh.
